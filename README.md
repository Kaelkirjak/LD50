# LD50 (Tartu Ülikooli Mängujämm 2022)

CUP HALF FULL is a Tetris like game where your goal is to keep the falling blocks from overfilling your cup. To do that, you can stack blocks in a way to create horizontal lines, that then vanish and award you points. To add a little bit of chaos, the blocks are very bouncy and like to knock each other out of their positions.

## Branches
